- This SQL project involves cleaning and standardizing data on company layoffs, including removing duplicates, standardizing industry names, trimming whitespace, and converting date formats. 
- Data is then analyzed through various queries to extract insights such as the maximum layoffs, companies with the highest layoffs, and the total layoffs by country and year. 
- The project highlights the usage of _Common Table Expressions (CTEs)_ and _window functions_ to calculate rolling totals and rank companies by layoffs per year.
